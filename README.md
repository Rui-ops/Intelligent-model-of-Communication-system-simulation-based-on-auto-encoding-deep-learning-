# Intelligent-model-of-Communication-system-simulation-based-on-auto-encoding-deep-learning

Used a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to simulate a optical communication system;

Applying auto-encoding deep-learning method to build an Intelligent model of Communication system in order to improve its information rate and symbol coding method;

laying a good foundation for the development of intelligent fiber communication systems;

This is my bachelor thesis project, and that's why I'll only put some part of the code here since I don't wanna get fined by my university or something
